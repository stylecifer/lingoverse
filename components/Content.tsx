  Alright, everybody, picture this up! I was on cloud nine, chatting away in my target language with awesome people from the seven seas. During the pandemic, life was a linguistic rollercoaster until Duolingo went and pulled the plug on their events website. <br/><Spacer y={0.7} />
  I didn't let that friendship fade away. Nah-uh. The connections I made with attendees and hosts felt as real as it gets. But I lost those little details, those addictive game-like elements that made language learning an endless joyride. Now, I'm on a social media scavenger hunt to find those moments again.<br/><Spacer y={0.7} />
  As a UX designer extraordinaire, I thought, â€œI'm going to take matters into my own hands!" So, I embarked on a coding adventure, learning the ropes, and bringing my fellow language lovers a place where we can relive that epic, laugh-out-loud journey of learning a new language.<br/><Spacer y={0.7} />
  You heard it right, me hearties, it's time to jump into the crew and <b>go for the treasure!</b></Text></Box>
