          <p>Hello there! I hope you're doing well. It's Antonio here, but you might know me as 'El ToÃ±ito' when we're navigating through the vast expanse of language learning into the Lingoverse.</p><br>

          <p>I've got a real treat for you today! I recently had the privilege of hopping on board the language spaceship with none other than Mellen K, the illustrious host of our beloved Language Exchange every Sunday at 12 pm New York Time.</p><br>
          
          <p>In this captivating interview, now available as a video for your viewing pleasure, you'll discover Mellen's motivation for learning languages, keeping alive Sundayâ€™s event in meetup and why he believes language exchange is the undefeatable technique for mastering a new tongue.</p><br>
          
          <p>"This is the one folks, the golden ticket to fluency!" Language exchange isn't just about learning a language; it's about immersing yourself in a whole new galaxy â€“ right from the comfort of your own home. In fact, it's like getting front-row seats to a world tour, without having to worry about losing your luggage!</p><br>
          
          <p>Let's make every Sunday a day of discovery in the Lingoverse! <br>
          
          Let me know in the comment if you're down</p>

          <p>Alright there, gang! Just recently, I had the absolute pleasure of sitting down (virtually, of course) with a man who has been at the heart of an extraordinary event for longer than he can quite remember. From the charming cobbles of Edinburgh, heâ€™s been changing lives and bridging cultures, one language exchange at a time.</p><br>
          <p>Our dear friend began his journey in the 90s, initially sparking connections through English and French exchanges. But as the winds of change blew, the call for Spanish grew louder than French, leading to a delightful blend of Spanish-English exchanges that now colour our Wednesdays.</p><br>
          <p>Now, hereâ€™s the kicker. Can you guess the unlikely silver lining that the dreadful pandemic brought us? It was none other than these fantastic weekly events, which are now hosted every Wednesday at 8 pm UK time.</p><br>
          <p>From amusing anecdotes about the bloke who dared to flaunt a skirt to the bar during the face-to-face events in Edinburgh, to unforgettable mishaps while attempting Spanish, every session promises laughter, learning, and a hearty sense of community.</p>
          <p>And it's not just about language learning, darlings. It's about the connections we make, the horizons we expand, and the knowledge we gain. It's not just about English, Spanish, or French; it's about opening ourselves to a whole new world of experiences and ideas.</p><br>
          <p>Now, you may be wondering, what does the future hold for our beloved language exchange? Well, our host has got it sorted. He absolutely loves the online group that we've built and doesn't plan on stopping the virtual events, even if face-to-face exchanges resume in Edinburgh.</p><br>
          <p>So, here's your invitation. Be it for the love of language, the joy of meeting people from around the world, or just to share a laugh at someone mixing up 'chat' and the past participle of 'ðŸ’©', join us every Wednesday. And who knows? You might pick up more than just a new language. You'll gain a story worth telling, a memory worth cherishing, and a friendship worth keeping.</p><br>
          <p>Intrigued? Just have a gander at this meetup to learn more about the event, the stories, and the man behind it all. See you next Wednesday!</p>
